### Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì Laboratory Exercises  

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Artificial Intelligence** course at the **Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)**.  

This organization serves as a **centralized space** for all repositories related to the laboratory exercises, assignments, and student projects conducted within the course. It brings together the collective work of students, assistants, and teaching staff in one structured and collaborative environment.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this organization is to provide a **unified platform** where:
- Students can **upload**, **document**, and **track** their laboratory work.  
- Teaching assistants can **review**, **evaluate**, and **maintain** student progress.  
- The entire course community can **collaborate**, **share**, and **exchange ideas** related to Artificial Intelligence.  

By maintaining a consistent structure and shared environment, we aim to ensure clarity, transparency, and effective teamwork throughout the semester.

## üß† About the Course

The **Artificial Intelligence** course covers both theoretical and practical foundations of AI, progressing from **classical paradigms** to **modern learning and optimization methods**.  

Students will explore and implement topics such as:
- **Problem-Solving and Search Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, A*, Alpha-Beta Pruning)  
- **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**  
- **Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Expert Systems and Logical Inference**  
- **Bio-Inspired Computing** (Genetic Algorithms, PSO, ACO)  
- **Intelligent Agents and Decision-Making**  

All laboratory exercises are implemented in **C++**, using the custom **natID** framework for algorithm visualization and experimentation.

## üß© Repository Structure

Each student has their own repository within this organization.  
Additionally, there are shared repositories that contain:
- Example solutions and templates  
- Core lab materials  
- Reference code and frameworks  

The **main laboratory repository** ([DSAI-Artificial-Intelligence-Laboratory-Exercises](https://github.com/DSAI-AI-Laboratory-Organization/DSAI-Artificial-Intelligence-Laboratory-Exercises)) contains example exercises and templates used throughout the semester.
